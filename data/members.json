His primary research interest lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Through his doctoral and postdoctoral work at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, INRIA (CEDAR team), and KAUST, he has assessed the limitations of current models in logical reasoning, fallacy detection, and belief revision, while developing benchmarks and tools to evaluate and improve their reasoning performance. Additionally, his research extends to Arabic NLP, studying biases in LLMs and AI applications in healthcare.",
